INTRODUCTION:

Angry terminal is a method of interacting with your computer by punching it.

It's written by Matt Mets in Processing (processing.org), and is released under the WTFPL.

USAGE:

Run the program. Alternate between hitting the left side of your keyboard (somewhere around the 's' key) and the right side (somewhere around the 'k' key) until you have selected a good letter, than hit both at the same time to select the letter. Hit them both again to send a carriage return.

RECOMMENDED:

An extra keyboard.
